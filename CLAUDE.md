This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

WarFaire (working title: "State Fair") is a strategic card game prototype built in Node.js. Players compete to win ribbons across multiple categories (Carrots, Pies, Pumpkins, etc.) that belong to groups (Produce, Baking, Livestock). The game features a unique progressive prestige system where popular categories become more valuable over time, and players must balance short-term wins with long-term strategy by playing cards face-down for future rounds.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Run a test game with 2 Fairs (default)
npm start

# Run a game with custom number of Fairs
node index.js 3

# No build, lint, or test commands configured yet
```

## Core Architecture

### Game Flow
The game operates in a hierarchical structure: **Game → Fairs → Rounds → Player Actions**

1. **Game** (`game.js`): Orchestrates the entire multi-Fair game
   - Manages active/inactive categories (rotates categories when < 10 players)
   - Handles deck creation and shuffling
   - Tracks category prestige progression across Fairs
   - Coordinates Fair and Round execution

2. **Fair**: A complete competition season consisting of 3 rounds
   - Categories gain prestige based on popularity
   - At Fair end, lowest-ranked category may be retired and replaced
   - Players accumulate ribbons and Victory Points

3. **Round** (`game.js:playRound`): One turn of gameplay
   - Players flip their face-down cards from the previous round
   - Draw 3 new cards
   - Play 1 card face-up (scores this Fair)
   - Play 1 card face-down (auto-plays at start of next Fair's corresponding round)

### Key Components

**Card System** (`card.js`):
- **Category Cards**: 13 cards per category with values [2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,5,5,6]
- **Group Cards**: 8 wild cards per group [2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] that can be played in any category within their group
- **Card.getEffectiveCategory()**: Returns the selected category for group cards, or the card's category otherwise
- 12 total categories across 3 groups (Produce, Baking, Livestock)

**Player State** (`player.js`):
- `hand`: Cards currently held (drawn but not played)
- `faceDownCards`: Cards queued to auto-play in future rounds
- `playedCards`: Cards played face-up this Fair (used for scoring)
- `ribbons`: Historical record of all ribbons earned with VP values
- `totalVP`: Cumulative Victory Points across all Fairs

**Scoring System** (`scorer.js`):
- **Category Scoring**: Top 3 players in each category earn ribbons (Gold/Silver/Bronze)
- **Ribbon Values**: Base values are Gold=2VP, Silver=1VP, Bronze=0VP, PLUS category prestige
- **Ties**: Multiple players can receive the same ribbon; skip lower ribbons accordingly
- **Group Winners**: Player with most VP from categories in a group wins that group
- **Prestige Progression**: Top 3 most-played categories gain +1 prestige after each Fair

### Game State Management

**Between Fairs** (`game.js:prepareNextFair`):
- Players keep: face-down cards (carry forward), ribbons (permanent), totalVP (cumulative)
- Players discard: hand, played cards
- Category rotation: If < 10 players, retire lowest-ranked category and introduce a new one
- Deck recreation: Build new deck from active categories (face-down cards not included in deck)
- Prestige persistence: Category prestige values carry forward and accumulate

### Current Implementation Status

The prototype uses **random AI** for all player decisions:
- Card selection in `game.js:playRound` (lines 103-131)
- Group card category selection when played
- To add interactive gameplay, modify these decision points to accept user input

**Not yet implemented**:
- Interactive player decisions (UI/input system)
- Multiplayer networking
- Test framework (no unit tests)
- Advanced variants from GDD.md (static prestige, hand carryover, etc.)
- Proper validation for invalid face-down cards when categories are retired

## Important Game Rules

1. **Face-down card timing**: Cards played face-down in Round N of Fair X auto-play at the start of Round N of Fair X+1
2. **Active categories**: Number of active categories = number of players + 1
3. **Group cards**: Must be assigned to a specific category within their group when played
4. **Category retirement**: Only happens when < 10 players AND inactive categories remain
5. **Deck composition**: Includes all active category cards PLUS all 3 groups' wild cards (24 group cards total)

## Code Conventions

- ES6 modules (`type: "module"` in package.json)
- Classes use PascalCase (Game, Player, Card)
- Methods use camelCase
- Constants use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (CATEGORIES, GROUPS, RIBBON_TYPES)
- Game logging uses `game.log()` which both stores and displays messages
